**passsenger only hyperloop: $6b**

**p+v hyperloop: $7.5b**

**p+freight hyperloop: $8.0b**

	- assuming p+v costs

	- $400m for larger tubes

	- $100m for sensor system

**the hyperloop will be able to generate upwards of $500m/yr in revenue.**

100 trips/hr * $500 * 24hr * 365 days = $438m
solar revenue: $100-200m/yr

**issues concerning the financing source(s):**

	- $3b+ in bureaucratic bloat, see [accounting.md](https://github.com/leonidkozhukh/hyperloop/blob/master/accounting.md)

	- engaging open source community & broader society

	- economic development of california

	- faster, cheaper, on-demand distribution for businesses

private ownership
=================

this poses several issues, namely the incentive for power structures to put obstacles in place so as to receive payment. a corollary to this issue is the incentivization of the public engagement is less clear. see [accounting.md](https://github.com/leonidkozhukh/hyperloop/blob/master/accounting.md) 

this case might clean up a lot of shipping traffic on the roads but, ultimately, could squeeze out the public use of the hyperloop. the financial case for running 24/7 for businesses shipping freight is pretty clear if the demand is there.

public ownership
================

this poses the issue of control structure and incentive for private patrons to participate. given the california govt approved a $68b rail project and the federal govt is currently shutdown, skepticism is warranted here both in terms of getting the hyperloop built and its continued operation.

however, this might stem the bureaucracy a bit.

patronage
=========

a hybrid approach, however unprecedented in todays world, appears to be the best way forward. akin to the renaissance era patronage, private patrons could finance the hyperloop and gift it to society. an appropriate control structure could operate the hyperloop without setting cashflow as the ultimate priority while, also, re-investing in further projects or other points of leverage for society.


post-hyperloop
==============

extending the original hyperloop to other major population centers is a possibility. creating hyperloops in other regions of the world is also possible.

the extension of the software systems created for the hyperloop could impact how other infrastructure projects are undertaken and how the govt, generally, can be more transparent and accountable. 

in order to create a new, global, sustainable transportation infrastructure several other pieces need to be developed. the supersonic electric jet is a high-elevation, tube-less analog of the hyperloop. space elevators - think 1000 spacex grasshoppers hovering in a vertical line - would enable space transport to use renewable energey, enable the ejet to connect the world, and provide a continuous connection from earth to space.

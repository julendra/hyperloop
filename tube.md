with a design around a freight container the tube costs could increase to $1.6b. the pillars require little adjustment and the original budget for them is extremely bloated already - see [finance.md](https://github.com/leonidkozhukh/hyperloop/blob/master/finance.md) 

reverse engineering the original spec numbers:

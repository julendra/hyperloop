**pillars from original spec**

6m - {563, 492, 10930, 2783} total: 14768

15m - {80, 260, 1056, 775} total: 2171

30m - {12, 795, 0, 159} total: 965

total: 17,904

spec: 25,000

*assuming: 2m, 3m, 4m square bases*

4m^2 * 6m * 14768 = 354,432 m^3

9m^2 * 15m * 2171 = 293,085 m^3

16m^2 * 30m * 965 = 463,200 m^3

total: 1,110,717 m^3

* 25000/17904 =

**1,550,934 m^3**

price of reinforced concrete + labor, etc = $400/m^3

**total cost: $620m**

*original spec cost: $3.15b*
